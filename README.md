Implemented a Dice Simulator in C# with a GUI (.net windows form app). 
OOP-based (Inheritance, Encapsulation)
The program lets you roll 2 dice, roll 60, 600, 6000, or 60000 times each die. Based on the number of rolls.
A histogram will update in real-time, and the proper stats will be displayed.
Some input validation to check provided for the seed input. The seed is used to initialized the random number generator.
